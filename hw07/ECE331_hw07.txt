	The assumptions:
	American style zip codes are 5 digit numbers with an optional "+4"
	The optional "+4" is a hyphen followed by a 4 digit number. Also
	zip codes are assumed to be located at word boundaries, such as
	after a space or before the end of the line.
	Minimum match: 04401
	Unintended matches include subtraction mathematical statements, such as
	12345-1111=11324, in which case the zip+4 and the 5 digit number after
	the equal sign are matched.
\b[0-9]{5}(-[0-9]{4})?\b

	The assumptions:
	English sentences must start with a capital letter and end with a period,
	exclamation point, or question mark. A sentence can consist of only one
	word as long as the previous criteria are met. Subsequent words in the
	sentence may start with capital letters, as those words are proper nouns.
	Other punctuation that may be used in sentences between words include
	commas, colons, and semicolons. There may also be single quotes, double
	quotes or parenthesis attached to the beginning or the ends of the words.
	Hyphenated words or words with apostrophes are considered as one word,
	but words may only contain letters, so those cases are not matched. It is
	assumed that the words in the sentence may be nonsensical or misspelled.
	Words may not be all capital letters except for single letter words, such
	as I. Consecutive punctuation is not allowed except for closing
	parenthesis or and quotes before the closing punctuation. There can also
	be double or single quote after the period. The following line is valid:
	She told me, "but you, I am afraid, are maidenless."
	Minimum match: A.
	Unintended matches include grammatically and orthographically incorrect
	sentences.
^[(\'\"]?[A-Z][a-z]*[)\'\"]?([\[,;:]? [(\'\"]?([A-Z]|[A-Z]?[a-z]+)[)\'\"]?)*[.?!][\'\"]?$

4c.
	The assumptions:
	There do not have to be characters within the parenthesis. If there is
	only one set of parenthesis then that must be the innermost set.
	If there are multiple innermost sets, like ((set1)(set2)), then both
	innermost sets are matched separately. Not all parenthesis must be matched.
	If there is an imbalance, then the innermost complete set is matched,
	for example in '(((((opens))', the regular expression matches (opens).
	Minimum match: ()
\([^()]*\)

	I would send an e-mail to my supervisor/manager saying what happened
	because it is important the higher-ups know what is going on. Also,
	admitting this makes me looks less suspicious and guilty in the audit.
	After all, even if I tried to hide the fact that I  unlawfully accessed
	the system, the supervisor would find out in the daily audit. I would then
	personally ask my supervisor to see if they got my e-mail. If required,
	I would further explain what I was doing, why I was doing it, and what
	I found. After that, I would accept any and all punishments because I
	should not have accessed the system in the manner I did in the first place.
