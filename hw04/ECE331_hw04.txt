    The command I used was:
	grep -Eh '^[0-9]+$' [0-9][0-9]
    The RE matches a sequence of 1 or more consecutive digits. The line
    must start with the first number of the sequence and end with the last.
    The files searched are all files in the current directory with a file name
    consisting of exactly two digits.

2a.
    The minimum match is a lowercase letter from a-z, followed by a
    non-line-terminating character, followed by 0. An example would be:
	ab0

2b.
    The minimum match is a line consisting of exactly one character. For example:
	5

2c.
    The minimum match is a single digit. For example:
	4

2d.
    The group in the RE matches 1 or more characters that are not lowercase
    letters from a-z. However, the RE matches 0 or more occurrences of that group.
    Therefore, the minimum match is a blank line with a line-terminator.

3a.
    The below RE matches binary numbers anchored at word boundaries.
	\b[0-1]+\b
    In the string: '101.1aa 101a 111', only 101 and 111 match. 1aa, and 101a do not match.

3b.
    The minimum match is a 0 or 1 at a word boundary, such as before the first character of a string,
    after the last character, next to punctuation, or whitespace.
    For example:
	1
