    The command I used was:
	grep -Eh '^[0-9]+$' [0-9][0-9]
    The RE matches a sequence of 1 or more consecutive digits. The line
    must start with the first number of the sequence and end with the last.
    The files searched are all files in the current directory with a file name
    consisting of exactly two digits. The 'h' argument to grep suppresses the file
    name being printed in the output.

2a.
    The minimum match is a lowercase letter from a-z, followed by a
    non-line-terminating character, followed by 0. An example would be:
	ab0

2b.
    The minimum match is a line consisting of exactly one character. For example:
	5

2c.
    The minimum match is a single digit. For example:
	4

2d.
    The group in the RE matches 1 or more characters that are not lowercase
    letters from a-z. However, the RE matches 0 or more occurrences of that group.
    Therefore, the minimum match is a blank line with a line-terminator.

3a.
    The below RE matches binary numbers anchored at word boundaries.
	\b[0-1]+\b
    In the string: '101.1aa 101a 111', only 101 and 111 match. 1aa, and 101a do not match.

3b.
    The minimum match is a 0 or 1 at a word boundary, such as before the first character of a string,
    after the last character, next to punctuation, or whitespace.
    For example:
	1
4.
    a.
	The below RE matches even integers. It matches consecutive digits as long
	as the last digit in the sequence is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. The number is located
	at a word boundary position, which includes being surrounded by whitespace or
	other punctuation that may be used in some kind of data file.
	    \b[0-9]*[2468]\b
    b.
	The minimum match is a line with a single even digit, such as 2

5.
    a.
	A description of floating point constants is outlined in section 6.4.4.2 of the
	ISO/IEC 9899 Revision of the C standard from 2011 (N1570). A decimal-floating-constant
	is comprised of an optional sign, a fractional-constant, an optional exponent-part,
	and an optional floating-suffix.
	The sign is a + or -
	The fractional constant is formed by the following:
	    optional digit-sequence . digit-sequence.
	The exponent-part is formed by either of the following:
	    e optional-sign digit-sequence
	    E optional-sign digit-sequence
	The floating-suffix is one of the following: l L f F
	Consolidating this information into an RE yielded the following:
	    [+-]?([0-9]*\.)?[0-9]+([eE][+-]?[0-9]+)?[fFlL]?
    b.
	The minimum match is a single digit, such as 2
